## PROPOSED THEME

* THEME - SPACE MINDFULNESS
* CHALLENGE - On the Shoulders of Giants

## CONTEXT

Planets, asteroids, constellations and everything that we know about in the universe are often seen as something complicated, known only by experts. Why not transform it into a child’s play? What if NASA could inspire children, in their early age, to think about the universe and to understand more about its grandiosity?

## PROBLEM

Children’s little interest and lack of stimulations about the universe and science.

## DESCRIPTION

* Genre: Recreational and Educational
* Platform: Mobile
* Target: Children from 5 to 7 years
* Core Narrative: Phases of the game are based on images from the Hubble telescope and its history, showing real pictures and therefore the beauty of reality itself.
* Main gameplay: The game will consist of quests and puzzles, varying according to the planets or galaxies in question. Little Hubble will be your guide and companion.

## WHERE WE DIFFERENTIATE

* INTERACTIVITY
* FUN AND STIMULATING CREATIVITY
* INFOS ABOUT HUBBLE AND NASA
* BRINGING CHILDREN CLOSER TO THE UNIVERSE

## CONCLUSION

We want to stimulate a deeper look at the sky, creativity, knowledge, the unknown, dreams. For it, let us encourage the best dreamers in the world: children, our future.
