# Little Hubble in Space 

Project developed for the largest hackton in the world by NASA. 

## Proposed Theme

THEME - SPACE MINDFULNESS
	CHALLENGE - On the Shoulders of Giants

## Context

O DIDDE é uma aplicação WEB.

Planets, asteroids, constellations and everything that we know about in the universe are often seen as something complicated, known only by experts. Why not transform it into a child’s play? What if NASA could inspire children, in their early age, to think about the universe and to understand more about its grandiosity?

## PROBLEM

Children’s little interest and lack of stimulations about the universe and science.

## DESCRIPTION

Genre: Recreational and Educational
Platform: Mobile
Target: Children from 5 to 7 years
Core Narrative: Phases of the game are based on images from the Hubble telescope and its history, showing real pictures and therefore the beauty of reality itself.
Main gameplay: The game will consist of quests and puzzles, varying according to the planets or galaxies in question. Little Hubble will be your guide and companion.
